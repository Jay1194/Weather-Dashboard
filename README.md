# Weather-Dashboard

## Description
I built a Weather Dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS, and uses Third-party APIs 
to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL and retrieving data from Open Weather 
API and using it in the context of my work and using the 5 Day Weather ForecastLinks to retrieve weather data for cities.
