# Weather-Dashboard

## Description
I developed a browser-based Weather Dashboard that utilizes dynamic HTML and CSS updates. It integrates Third-party APIs to access their capabilities, employing targeted URL requests with parameters to retrieve data from the Open Weather API. This data is then seamlessly incorporated into my project, specifically for obtaining weather information about various cities through the 5 Day Weather ForecastLinks.
